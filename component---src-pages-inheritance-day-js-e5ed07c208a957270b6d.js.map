On this day, we envision\n          we are 150 years in the future, and humans have learned to live\n         in harmony with each other and the planet. War is a thing of the past.\n         The global community eliminated poverty and ensured that every person has food,\n         shelter, and healthcare by focusing on thriving and abundance for all. We have learned\n         how to live lightly and sustainably with the planet, there is renewable energy for all,\n          and the earth's systems have been restored to a healthy balance. Women, LGBTQIA folx,\n          and people of all cultures, colors and religious beliefs have equal rights and freedoms worldwide.</p>\n          <p>So we sit down to dinner with our families, both birth and chosen, and celebrate these\n          incredible achievements that our ancestors worked so hard for! The meal\n          has a special set of courses, similar to Passover (with a dash of Thanksgiving),\n          and each one honors the important historical milestones that we achieved.\n          We ring a special bell at the start of each course, so we name them Bell 1,\n          Bell 2, etc. and each bell has associated activities/ritual. We also use this\n          dinner to reflect on our own ancestral lineage and cultural heritage that\n          lead to us being alive today on this incredible mother earth.</p>\n        <p>We invite you to adopt this holiday as your own. Below you will\n        find our suggested plan for the ritual, including a sample menu, but feel\n        free to adapt as desired! Below that is a sample invitation you could send\n        out to your friends and family.</p>\n      </div>\n    </Panel>\n\n  </Layout>\n\n)\n\nexport default InheritanceDayPage\nexport { Head } from \"../components/page-head\""],"names":["InheritanceDayPage","React","Layout","className","Panel","justification","Headline","title","subtitle","StaticImage","src","alt","__imageData","require"],"sourceRoot":""}
