        <p>We have structured our organization in a way that represents our values, creating diverse options for how we fill our wells, and allow supporters and partners to contribute resources to our mission. Currently, we manage Terran Collective LLC, a software development and consulting agency that works with aligned partners like DAOstack. Our agency is our primary source of income, which funds our pro bono work to care for our bioregion.</p>
        <p>Moving forward, we want to offer more and more in the spirit of the gift. Thus, we are birthing Terran Watershed as the source of life that will allow us to more fully pursue our purpose and share our gifts with the world.</p>
        <p>Terran Watershed is a non-profit 501c3, fiscally sponsored by our friends and allies at <a href="https://www.empowermentworks.org/">Empowerment Works</a>. We are asking for contributions to our Watershed in the form of tax deductible donations.</p>
        <p>Our work in five comprehensive scopes of practice - storytelling, community, technology, mapping, and commoning - is in the form of a gift. Your donations to Terran Watershed will provide resources for our core team to thrive and do our lifeâ€™s work, nourishing our ability to offer these gifts to the world.</p>

              <p>Achieving our goals will require major shifts in our cultural narratives, to evolve deep-rooted  beliefs of fear, scarcity and separation to agency, abundance and interdependence.

              <p>In order to transition from an extractive system to a closed-loop, regenerative system, we must map resource flows and share the findings transparently. During 2020, we will map the ecosystem of regenerative projects in the San Francisco Bay Area. Our research examines the hidden landscape of the human and natural world, and how we can build networks so that resources, energy and knowledge flow freely outside of the market.</p>

              <p>With new maps, technology, and a culture that has learned how to rely on community and relationships, a new cooperative landscape opens up. Stewarding this rebirthed commons will only be possible with evolved systems for collective ownership, decision-making and governance. We seek to build models that allow for communities to steward commons in ways that are more efficient and more empowering than current corporate, non-profit or governmental platforms.</p>

        <p>Divestors are people who understand the need to transfer resources from the extractive economy to the regenerative economy as quickly as possible. Transforming fixed fiat wealth into cascading ecosystem/bioregional/living abundance. So currency may become a current for good. <span role="img" aria-label="ocean wave">ðŸŒŠ</span></p>
        <p>Investment looks for returns for the investor, usually within a time-horizon that causes investors to think in very short terms. Our plan for economic and ecologic thriving is long-term: We are developing systems, tools and communities that work for the seven generations yet to come. When you divest into this collective, you are seeking returns for your grandchildren and the bioregional communities within which they will thrive.</p>

          </div>
          <p>For the last three years we have contributed our extra time and energy, and have supported each other financially to work on this vision. We are committed to building a way of life that realizes the hopes in our hearts, and we see this as a lifetime project. Any resources we receive, any help we receive, will help us to accomplish our goals sooner, and be able to share our research, tools and systems with the world more rapidly</p>
          <p>We are doing this work for the people and the Earth, not to enrich ourselves or investors. We donâ€™t expect traditional investment structures such as venture capital to understand the value of this work, so we are asking you, our community, to join with us in creating a better world. Please consider giving a monthly donation of time or money. We believe that the community patronage model could be an example of how we can fund the transformative work that is required at this time. We are also of course happy to accept larger one time donations  to give us a big rocket boost as we leap into this work whole-heartedly.</p>
          <p>We are asking you to trust us and join us in this radical experiment, to see if we can give ourselves over completely to be of service to our bioregion and the world. Now is the time for to put our energy and resources into radical experimentation and change. The world is calling for a transition from the extractive economy into the regenerative economy, so we can liberate our communities, ecosystems, and align with our true value systems. And stop us from destroying ourselves and the planet. Help us begin right now, right here, with us.</p>
