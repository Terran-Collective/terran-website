          <p>Terran Collective’s work is creating tools, systems and practices that bring us closer together, build trust, and allow us to coordinate bioregional decision making and collective action effectively. All technology encodes the worldview of its authors. What happens if we create technology in service to All Beings Thriving?  We want to create free and open-source software, for everyone, to advance the transition to a sacred and regenerative economy. We are also experimenting with cooperative human practices of coordination like decentralized governance and gift economics. </p>

        <p>We are technologists, software developers and designers with decades of experience.   We see an opportunity for technology to increase interdependence, collaboration and cooperation without coercion or manipulation. We create software tools that map relationships, resources, needs, skills and offerings, and that allow people to coordinate collective action, activating them to participate in the regeneration of the world. We aim to create a tech commons and utilities for all, not just products for those who can afford them. </p>

        <p>We are architects, systems & process thinkers, permaculturists and experienced leaders. We are using our abilities to design and experiment with new ways of working together, sharing resources, group decision making and how to steward commons. We are focusing on bioregional systems that will allow people anywhere in the world to actively participate in the stewardship of the land around them.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><span>Identifying Regenerative Players:</span> We seek the key regenerators in the bioregion to build partnerships to understand their needs. This a key step in the project of creating a comprehensive collaborative map of the bioregional ecosystem. We have a comprehensive plan for the tools we believe are needed, and we’ll start with those that are most important to our partners in this bioregion.</p>

                <p><span>Seeding bioregional Guilds for across many regenerative sectors:</span> We see creating modern Guilds as an important way to help those already doing regenerative work in our bioregion to coordinate more effectively. These guilds will bring together everyone working in a particular field, for example agriculture, education, technology, governance, etc. into an organizational structure designed to foster collaboration amongst existing projects. Guilds will help make sure work isn’t being duplicated, information and knowledge is being shared, and resources are flowing where they are needed at the right time. We are just beginning the project of helping these guilds form, and see this as an important medium term project we can help steward. </p>
