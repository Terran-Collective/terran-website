          <p>Terran Collective's work is creating tools, systems, and practices that bring us closer together, build trust, and allow us to coordinate to care for our world. All technology encodes the worldview of its creators. What happens if we create technology in service to life?  We want to create free and open-source software for everyone, to advance the transition to a regenerative economy. We are also experimenting with cooperative human practices of coordination like decentralized governance and gift economics.</p>

        <p>We are community builders and weavers, and believe that the best way to coordinate is within the context of healthy relationships. We know that we can only move at the speed of trust, and believe that building trust takes consistent connection and showing up for each other over time.</p>
        <p>We host gatherings that foster trust and collaboration and allow participants to imagine a more beautiful future. These include campouts, dinners, trainings and councils to build community as well as bigger convenings like our recent <a href="http://terrancospiracy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terran Cospiracy</a> to grow our collective intelligence.</p>
        <p>We also participate in and experiment with group processes, including the <a href="https://waysofcouncil.net/what-is-council/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Way of Council</a> and the <a href="https://workthatreconnects.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Work that Reconnects</a> for facilitating gatherings, deepening relationships, and resolving conflicts without violence. </p>

        <p>Our land, our resources, and our communities are a commons. How can we return to an understanding that governing our shared resources is a shared responsibility? Rebuilding the commons worldview and our ability to collectively govern is the core of our theory of change.</p>

These guilds will bring together everyone working in a particular field, for example agriculture, education, technology, governance, etc. into an organizational structure designed to foster collaboration amongst existing projects. Guilds will help make sure work isnâ€™t being duplicated, information and knowledge is being shared, and resources are flowing where they are needed at the right time. We are just beginning the project of helping these guilds form, and see this as an important medium term project we can help steward. </p>

        <p>We are storytellers, artists and writers, who know that we will not be able to accomplish our goals without deep cultural shifts. For example, mitigating climate change will require wholesale changes to our economic systems, and that will require new stories about what we value and why. </p>
        <p>Learning how to tell these stories of interbeing and abundance in a way that creates a movement and spreads far and wide is a big project. Even though we believe that at the core we need to find deep alignment, different communities will respond to different ways of expressing the same fundamental values. So we are experimenting with various messages and mediums of storytelling through blog posts, meme creation, and events of all kinds.</p>
