          <p>Terran Collective is <strong>a community</strong> of people who are committed to the work of healing and transformation necessary for all beings in our bioregion to thrive.</p>
          <p>Terran is <strong>a living system</strong>. We embrace our interdependence with the web of life, and believe that there is abundance for all on this beautiful planet. To get there, we must re-design how humans relate to each other and the planet, applying the lessons of emergent strategy to adaptation, decentralization, fractal awareness, resilience, and iterative change to our work.</p>
          <p>As a <strong>community of care</strong>, we support each other on our paths of personal healing and growth. As <strong>a community of practice</strong>, we help each other find our purpose and share our gifts with the world, while collaborating on projects aligned with our mission. As <strong>a commons</strong>, we collectively govern and share resources.</p>
          <p>Relating in these new and remembered ways provides the laboratory through which we research and experiment with creating bioregional collective intelligence, in service to all beings thriving.</p>

          <p>Terran Collective builds community and socio-technical tools to coordinate action. We aim to develop cooperative systems of coordination that can outcompete the market/state while nurturing healthy relationships with each other and the planet.</p>
          <p><strong>Community Weaving:</strong> Rebuilding community is the core of our theory of change. Through community we can develop resilience amidst rapid change, allowing us to navigate the ecological, political, cultural crises we face today.</p>
          <p><strong>Technology:</strong> We design software that serves human thriving, by supporting community building, collaborative sensemaking, cooperative decision-making and group coordination.</p>
          <p><strong>Collaborative Ecosystem Mapping:</strong> We are making transparent maps of our communities and using them to deepen relationships and collectively manage our resources.</p>
