          <p>Terran Collective is a community of people who are committed to the work of healing and transformation necessary for all beings in our bioregion to have what they need to thrive.</p>
          <p>As a <strong>community of care</strong>, we support each other on our paths of personal healing and growth. As a <strong>community of practice</strong>, we help each other find our purpose and share our gifts with the world, while collaborating on projects aligned with our mission. As <strong>a commons</strong>, we collectively govern and share resources.</p>
          <p>Terran is <strong>a living system</strong>. We embrace our interdependence with the web of life, and believe that there is abundance for all on this beautiful planet. To get there, we must re-design how humans relate to each other and the planet, applying the lessons of emergent strategy - adaptation, decentralization, fractal awareness, resilience, and iterative change - to our work.</p>

                <strong>Community Weaving</strong>
                Rebuilding community is the core of our theory of change. Through community we can develop resilience amidst rapid change, allowing us to navigate the ecological, political, and cultural crises we face today.

          <p>A bioregion is a geographical and cultural area defined by the emergent boundaries expressed by nature. This is the scale at which we work; building systems and tools that are grounded in place. The economic, ecological and social landscapes that we seek to improve are those of the land we inhabit, the San Francisco Bay Area bioregion.</p>
          <p>In the initial phase of our work, we are identifying the variables and components of a thriving bioregion. We are using what we learn to build tools that enable collective intelligence for bioregions everywhere. By sharing our findings, we hope to activate bioregions around the globe, create a coherent network of place-based collaborators, and actualize a thriving biosphere.</p>
