We are called to know the plants and animals that make their home alongside us. This is the land that is ours to heal. The world is alive and is always speaking to us.

Drawing a strict boundary is less important than understanding the rich cultural, economic, agricultural, and environmental exchange across this influential area. We are members of Cascadia bioregion. We are constituents of the nature-state of Salmon Nation. We are the people of the redwoods, of blackberries, of the redtail hawk, the black-tailed deer, the coyote, the raven. Our invitation is to fall in love with our land.

We live embedded in many structures for collective intelligence, for example our our governments and economic systems, that are no longer serving the needs of our species or our planet. Terran is designing and practicing new and remembered models of collective intelligence that will allow us to make both smarter and wiser decisions for the whole. We fit our vision for collective intelligence to the scale of the bioregion, which is an ecologically-created polity that naturally aligns the interests of the people sharing that landscape. The bioregion is the level at which it is imperative we learn to coordinate action and collectively govern ourselves.</p>\n          <p>We also believe it is imperative that we bring all forms of intelligence to the table to make truly wise decisions. This means including diverse viewpoints, incorporating not just knowledge and mental intelligence but also integrating the intelligence of our hearts and bodies, our feelings and our intuitions. And we must listen to the wisdom of the living Earth and the more-than-human community with whom we share the biosphere.
